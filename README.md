# My projects and skills

A simple website that showcases my programming projects. Also showcases which programming languages, frameworks and software I use.

## Setup

This project requires `PROJECT_PORT` and `PROJECT_NAME` to be defined inside a `.env` file:

```
PROJECT_PORT=3000
PROJECT_NAME="Homepage"
```
